This small project aimed to explore how socioeconomic variables like age, gender, marital status, and occupation influence purchasing behavior during Black Friday. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncovered patterns such as the dominance of the 26â€“35 age group, higher participation by males, and significant spending by occupation groups 0, 4, and 17. Visualizations of purchase distributions and demographic trends helped identify key consumer segments and informed our recommendations for targeted marketing strategies. While the model performed well in predicting low to mid-range purchases, it underpredicted high-value purchases, indicating room for improvement. All supporting code, dataset, report, and presentation are included in this repository.
